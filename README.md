# Welcome to your how.fm coding challenge :wave:

This project was originally bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Refer to the original README `ReactAppREADME.md` to find out how to run the project using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) scripts.

You might already know it from our [public preparation repository](https://github.com/howfm-hiring/web_frontend_case_study_prep).

Have fun and good luck :dizzy:
